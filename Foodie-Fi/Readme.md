### Customer Journey Mapping

**Multi-Customer Onboarding Analysis**
```sql
-- Track customer journey across multiple plan transitions
SELECT s.customer_id, plan_name, s.start_date 
FROM plans p 
JOIN subscriptions s USING(plan_id)
WHERE s.customer_id IN ('1', '2','11','13','15','16','18','19')
GROUP BY s.customer_id, plan_name, s.start_date;
```

- Customer 2: Trial ‚Üí Pro Annual (Premium upgrade)
- Customer 11: Trial ‚Üí Churn (Early dropout)
- Customer 13: Trial ‚Üí Basic ‚Üí Pro Monthly (Gradual upgrade)
- Customer 15: Trial ‚Üí Pro Monthly ‚Üí Churn (Premium churn)
- Customer 16: Trial ‚Üí Basic ‚Üí Pro Annual (Long-term conversion)
- Customer 18: Trial ‚Üí Pro Monthly (Direct premium)
- Customer 19: Trial ‚Üí Pro Monthly ‚Üí Pro Annual (Premium evolution)

### Subscription Analytics

**Total Customer Base**
```sql
-- Unique customer count across all time
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(customer_id)) AS no_of_customers 
FROM subscriptions;
```

**Monthly Trial Distribution**
```sql
-- Trial signup patterns by month
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(start_date,'%m-%Y') AS trials, 
       COUNT(*) AS trial_count
FROM subscriptions
WHERE plan_id = 0
GROUP BY trials
ORDER BY trials;
```

### Advanced Churn Analysis

**Customer Churn Rate Calculation**
```sql
-- Churn percentage with precision
SELECT plan_name, 
       COUNT(DISTINCT(customer_id)) AS cust_count, 
       ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT(customer_id)) * 100 / 
             (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(customer_id)) FROM subscriptions), 2) AS percentage
FROM subscriptions s 
JOIN plans p USING(plan_id)
WHERE plan_id = 4
GROUP BY plan_name;
```

**Trial-to-Churn Analysis**
```sql
-- Customers churning immediately after trial
WITH trial_churn AS (
    SELECT customer_id
    FROM subscriptions
    WHERE plan_id = 0
)
SELECT 
    COUNT(s.customer_id) AS churned_customers,
    ROUND((COUNT(s.customer_id) * 100.0) / 
          (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM subscriptions), 0) AS churn_percentage
FROM subscriptions s
JOIN trial_churn t ON s.customer_id = t.customer_id
WHERE s.plan_id = 4;
```

### Conversion Time Analysis

**Average Days to Annual Upgrade**
```sql
-- Time from trial to annual subscription
SELECT ROUND(AVG(DATEDIFF(a.start_date, t.start_date)), 0) AS avg_days_to_annual
FROM subscriptions t
JOIN subscriptions a ON t.customer_id = a.customer_id
WHERE t.plan_id = 0 AND a.plan_id = 3;
```

### Plan Transition Analytics

**Post-Trial Plan Distribution**
```sql
-- Customer distribution after free trial
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS cust_count, 
       ROUND((COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) * 100.0) / 
             (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM subscriptions), 1) AS percentage
FROM subscriptions
WHERE plan_id NOT IN ('0', '4');
```

**Downgrade Pattern Analysis**
```sql
-- Pro Monthly to Basic Monthly downgrades
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT s1.customer_id) AS cust_count 
FROM subscriptions s1 
JOIN subscriptions s2 ON s1.customer_id = s2.customer_id
WHERE s1.plan_id = 1 AND s2.plan_id = 2 
  AND s1.start_date BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31';
```

### Year-End Subscription Analysis

**Plan Breakdown at Year-End**
```sql
-- Customer distribution by plan at 2020-12-31
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS cust_count, 
       ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) * 100.0 / 
             (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM subscriptions), 2) AS percentage,
       plan_name 
FROM plans p 
JOIN subscriptions s USING(plan_id)
WHERE start_date <= '2020-12-31' 
  AND customer_id NOT IN (
      SELECT customer_id FROM subscriptions WHERE start_date > '2020-12-31'
  )
GROUP BY plan_name;
```

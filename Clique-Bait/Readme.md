### Digital Analytics Queries

**User Count Analysis**
```sql

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;
```

**Cookie Distribution**
```sql
-- Average cookies per user
SELECT COUNT(cookie_id), user_id FROM users 
GROUP BY user_id;
```

```sql
-- Unique visits identification
SELECT DISTINCT(visit_id) FROM events;
```

```sql
-- Event frequency by type
SELECT COUNT(event_type), event_type FROM events 
GROUP BY event_type;
```

**Conversion Rate Calculation**
```sql
-- Purchase event percentage
SELECT event_type, COUNT(*), 
       ROUND(COUNT(*)*100/(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM events), 2) 
FROM events
GROUP BY event_type;
```

### Advanced Conversion Analysis

**Checkout Abandonment Rate**
```sql
-- Users who viewed checkout but didn't purchase
WITH checkout_users AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT user_id 
    FROM events e
    JOIN page_hierarchy p ON e.page_id = p.page_id
    WHERE p.page_name = 'Checkout'
),
purchase_users AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT user_id 
    FROM events 
    WHERE event_type = 'purchase'
)
SELECT 
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM checkout_users) - 
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM purchase_users) AS abandoned_checkouts;
```

### User Journey Mapping

**Page Flow Analysis**
```sql
-- Most common page sequences
SELECT 
    p1.page_name as first_page,
    p2.page_name as second_page,
    COUNT(*) as sequence_count
FROM events e1
JOIN events e2 ON e1.user_id = e2.user_id 
    AND e1.event_time < e2.event_time
JOIN page_hierarchy p1 ON e1.page_id = p1.page_id
JOIN page_hierarchy p2 ON e2.page_id = p2.page_id
GROUP BY p1.page_name, p2.page_name
ORDER BY sequence_count DESC;
```

### Campaign Attribution Analysis

**Multi-Touch Attribution**
```sql
-- Campaign contribution to conversions
SELECT 
    c.campaign_name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT e.user_id) as influenced_users,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN e.event_type = 'purchase' THEN 1 END) as conversions
FROM events e
JOIN campaign_identifier c ON e.campaign_id = c.campaign_id
GROUP BY c.campaign_name;
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- MySQL 8.0+ or MariaDB 10.3+
- Database user with CREATE, ALTER, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE privileges
- Understanding of stored procedures and functions

### Database Setup

1. **Initialize the employees database**
   ```sql
   USE employees;
   ```

2. **Configure SQL mode for compatibility**
   ```sql
   SET @@global.sql_mode := REPLACE(@@global.sql_mode, 'ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY', '');
   ```

3. **Run the provided scripts to create custom tables and procedures**

## üìã Advanced SQL Techniques Demonstrated

### Complex Data Manipulation

**Dynamic Table Creation with Constraints**
```sql
CREATE TABLE department_dups (
    dept_no VARCHAR(20),
    dept_name CHAR(40) NULL
);

ALTER TABLE department_dups MODIFY dept_no VARCHAR(4) NULL;
```

**Conditional Data Updates**
```sql
UPDATE department_dups 
SET dept_no = "d01" 
WHERE dept_name = "Public relations";
```

### Advanced Join Operations

**Multi-Table JOIN with Complex Conditions**
```sql
SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, e.hire_date, dm.from_date, d.dept_name
FROM employees e 
JOIN dept_manager dm ON e.emp_no = dm.emp_no
JOIN departments d ON d.dept_no = dm.dept_no;
```

**Cross Join with Filtering**
```sql
SELECT dm.*, d.*
FROM dept_manager dm
CROSS JOIN departments d 
WHERE d.dept_no = "d009"
ORDER BY dm.emp_no;
```

### Stored Procedures

**Employee Information Retrieval**
```sql
DELIMITER $$
CREATE PROCEDURE emp_info(
    IN p_first_name VARCHAR(255), 
    IN p_last_name VARCHAR(255), 
    OUT p_emp_no INTEGER
)
BEGIN
    SELECT e.emp_no INTO p_emp_no 
    FROM employees e
    WHERE e.first_name = p_first_name AND e.last_name = p_last_name;
END$$
DELIMITER ;
```

**Average Salary Calculation**
```sql
DELIMITER $$
CREATE PROCEDURE return_avg_salary1(
    OUT p_avg_salary DECIMAL(10,2),
    IN p_emp_no INTEGER
)
BEGIN 
    SELECT AVG(salary) INTO p_avg_salary 
    FROM salaries s 
    WHERE p_emp_no = s.emp_no;
END$$
DELIMITER ;
```

### User-Defined Functions

**Employee Salary Lookup Function**
```sql
DELIMITER $$
CREATE FUNCTION f_emp_salary(
    p_first_name VARCHAR(30), 
    p_last_name VARCHAR(30)
) RETURNS INTEGER
DETERMINISTIC
BEGIN
    DECLARE v_emp_salary INTEGER;
    SELECT s.salary INTO v_emp_salary 
    FROM employees e 
    JOIN salaries s ON e.emp_no = s.emp_no 
    WHERE e.first_name = p_first_name AND e.last_name = p_last_name;
    RETURN v_emp_salary;
END$$
DELIMITER ;
```

### Window Functions & Analytics

**Employee Ranking with Partitioning**
```sql
SELECT emp_no, first_name, last_name, 
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER(
           PARTITION BY first_name 
           ORDER BY last_name DESC
       ) AS row_num
FROM employees;
```

**Department Manager Ranking**
```sql
SELECT emp_no, dept_no,
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY emp_no) AS row_num
FROM dept_manager;
```

### Advanced Subqueries

**EXISTS Clause with Correlated Subquery**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees e 
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT * FROM titles t 
    WHERE t.emp_no = e.emp_no AND title = "Assistant Engineer"
);
```

**IN Clause with Date Range Filtering**
```sql
SELECT * FROM dept_manager 
WHERE emp_no IN (
    SELECT emp_no FROM employees 
    WHERE hire_date BETWEEN '1990-01-01' AND '1995-01-01'
);
```

### Complex UNION Operations

**Combining Employee and Manager Data**
```sql
SELECT e.emp_no, e.first_name, e.last_name, NULL AS dept_no, NULL AS from_date
FROM employees e 
WHERE last_name = 'denis' 
UNION ALL 
SELECT NULL AS emp_no, NULL AS first_name, NULL AS last_name, dm.dept_no, dm.from_date
FROM dept_manager dm
ORDER BY -emp_no DESC;
```

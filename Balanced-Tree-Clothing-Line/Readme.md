        PERCENT_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY price) AS percentile_rank
    FROM product_sales
)
SELECT 
    MAX(CASE WHEN percentile_rank <= 0.25 THEN price END) AS "25th Percentile",
    MAX(CASE WHEN percentile_rank <= 0.50 THEN price END) AS "50th Percentile",
    MAX(CASE WHEN percentile_rank <= 0.75 THEN price END) AS "75th Percentile"
FROM ranked_data;
```

### Customer Segmentation Analysis

**Member vs Non-Member Transaction Split**
```sql

    END AS category,
    COUNT(*) AS txn_id,
    ROUND((COUNT(*) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM product_sales)), 2) AS percentage_split
FROM product_sales
GROUP BY category;
```

```sql
SELECT 
    CASE
        WHEN member = 't' THEN 'Member'

**Product Penetration Rate**
```sql
SELECT 
    prod_id,
    COUNT(DISTINCT txn_id) AS transactions_with_product,
    COUNT(DISTINCT txn_id) * 1.0 / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT txn_id) FROM product_sales) AS penetration
FROM product_sales
GROUP BY prod_id;
```

### Complex Basket Analysis

**Most Common 3-Product Combinations**
```sql
SELECT 
    p1.prod_id AS product_1,
    p2.prod_id AS product_2,
    p3.prod_id AS product_3,
    COUNT(*) AS frequency
FROM product_sales p1
JOIN product_sales p2 ON p1.prod_id = p2.prod_id AND p1.prod_id < p2.prod_id
JOIN product_sales p3 ON p3.prod_id = p2.prod_id AND p2.prod_id < p3.prod_id
WHERE p1.qty > 0 AND p2.qty > 0 AND p3.qty > 0
GROUP BY p1.prod_id, p2.prod_id, p3.prod_id
ORDER BY frequency DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

### Revenue Distribution Analysis

**Percentage Split by Segment**
